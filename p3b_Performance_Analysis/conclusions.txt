p3b CONCLUSIONS.TXT

Complete p3b and answer the following questions using results of running JDK Mission Control to justify your conclusions..

1) What can you tell about the performance of your hash table implementation compared to Java's tree map? 
Explain why (or when) your hash table is better or worse than Java's Tree Map.

For insert methods, hashtable is way worse than treemap. This seems to be because of resizing hash table.
For get method, hashtable is significantly better than treemap. Basically time complexity of hashtable.get is constant, which is lower than log(n).

2) What did you observe in jdk mission control to come to the conclusion above?

Counts of hashtable.insert was larger than treemap.put.
On the other hand hashtable.get had one count or none while treemap.get has more counts.

3) SCREENSHOT_001.PNG NOTES: Briefly describe what this image 001 shows

Screenshot that shows hashtable.insert behaves worse than treemap.put

4) SCREENSHOT_002.PNG NOTES: Briefly describe what this image 002 shows

Comparison of the first screenshot that shows hashtable.insert is worse than treemap.put

5) Describe other screenshots if you include them in your submission.

Screenshot shows hashtable.get with one count -> shows hashtable.get is significatly better than treemap.get
